# 🔐 **AI-Powered Network Traffic Classification & Threat Detection System**

## 📘 **Project Goal**

To build a **modular ML-based system** to classify network traffic and detect anomalies or threats (even in encrypted traffic) using AI/ML. This system will help identify malicious traffic in real time, with high accuracy, low false positives, and no need for manual rule-setting.

## 📒 **File-wise Breakdown**

### ✅ `1_data_collection_and_exploration.ipynb`

* Load the dataset (e.g., CICIDS2017)
* Explore features and labels
* Visualize class distributions, packet sizes, protocol types

### ✅ `2_data_preprocessing_and_feature_engineering.ipynb`

* Clean data (drop nulls, convert types)
* Encode labels and protocols
* Normalize/scale features
* Split features (`X`) and labels (`y`)

### ✅ `3_model_training_and_evaluation.ipynb`

* Train a classifier (e.g., RandomForest, XGBoost)
* Evaluate using accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix
* Save model to `models/classifier.pkl`

### ✅ `4_anomaly_detection_model.ipynb`

* Train an unsupervised model (e.g., IsolationForest) only on normal traffic
* Predict anomalies on mixed traffic
* Save model to `models/anomaly_model.pkl`

### ✅ `5_real_time_simulation_and_prediction.ipynb`

* Load saved model(s)
* Simulate real-time predictions by looping through random samples
* Print or log predictions every few seconds

### ✅ `6_dashboard_visualization.ipynb` *(Optional)*

* Build interactive dashboard (e.g., using `plotly`, `streamlit`, or `dash`)
* Show:

  * Real-time class predictions
  * Packet statistics over time
  * Anomaly scores

---

## 📁 `data/` Folder

* Place dataset here (e.g., `CICIDS2017.csv`)
* Recommended: Use preprocessed dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cicdataset/cicids2017)

---

## 📁 `models/` Folder

* Will contain trained model files:

  * `classifier.pkl` (supervised model)
  * `anomaly_model.pkl` (unsupervised anomaly detector)

---

## 📁 `utils/` Folder

* Place helper functions if needed
* For example: `feature_extraction.py` can hold flow statistics extractor

---

## 📄 `README.md`

* Write project overview, setup steps, dependencies, how to run each notebook

---

## 🧠 **Skills Covered**

* ML Pipeline: Load → Preprocess → Train → Evaluate → Predict
* Traffic classification
* Threat & anomaly detection
* Real-time simulation
* Optional dashboards
* Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, Streamlit
